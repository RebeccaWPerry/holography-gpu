Subject: Re: Permissions for use of SBESJY.FOR

Dear Jerome,

I am pleased to learn that my code SBESJY is of use to you. I am happy for
you to share the code with collaborators and others as you described. I
regard the code as open source and public domain as indeed are all my
published programs. Detailed discussions explaining the method are in the
.TEX, .DVI and .PDF files at the fresco address.

If you have questions please contact me.

Best wishes,

Ross Barnett
