Tutorials
=========

This section contains examples of how to use most of the functionality
in HoloPy. Each example starts with a full code listing suitable for
pasting into a terminal or for serving as a template for a script.

You will be happiest running these examples in an IPython terminal
(``ipython --pylab``, also called pylab shell in EPD). It is our intent
that these tutorials be easy to follow for anyone with a little
knowledge of python, holography, and scattering. If you find anything
confusing, we consider it a bug, and would like you to `report
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/holopy/+filebug>`_ it.
